GENERAL INFO:
Nonogram-qt is a puzzle game that will generate (semi)random nonogram puzzles, and allow the user to
solve them. Please see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram for more info on nonograms.

DEPENDENCIES:
Nonogram-qt requires Qt4 to work. (It is not yet tested on the, at the time of this writing, very, very
new Qt5.)

LICENSE:
Nonogram-qt and all its components is distributed under the GNU GPL v3 (or later). Please see the file
"COPYING" for more details.

INSTALLATION:
In addition to a C++ compatible compiler (such as g++) & toolchain you need the Qt development libraries
installed. Once you have these, simply run:

qmake && make

This should produce a stand-alone executable named "nonogram-qt". You can use this locally, or if you
have admin privileges install it system wide by running e.g.

sudo cp nonogram-qt /usr/bin
